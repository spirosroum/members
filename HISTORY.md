# Changelog — GymDesk (Sloth Submission Grappling)

## 2026-08-10 — v0.32 (14:00) — Fix admin writes silently failing: Firestore rules denied notification creates
- ROOT CAUSE of the disappearing payments/notifications all along: the `notifications` collection rule only allowed `create: if isKiosk()`. Admin tokens carry an email claim, so `isKiosk()` returns false for them — admin-created notifications (Member Activated, New Member Registered, Debt Cleared) were always DENIED
- Because Firestore batches are atomic, the payment/member/notification saves in the same 600ms-debounced batch FAILED TOGETHER: the payment and member update never reached Firestore (they existed only in localStorage and vanished on refresh/wipe), and the notification was never stored
- `firestore.rules` now allows `create: if isAdmin() || isKiosk()` for notifications — admin can now create notifications, so the whole batch commits
- DEPLOY REQUIRED: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` (the JS app was fine; only the rules were wrong)

## 2026-08-10 — v0.31 (13:30) — Fix payments & sensitive data wiped on every page load
- Root cause: `App.lockAdmin()` was called during `App.init()` (before `initAuth()`), which immediately called `clearSensitiveData()` — wiping payments, notifications, bins, and member PII from STATE and localStorage on every page load, BEFORE the Firestore listener that reloads them had been set up. On next page load, `localStorage['gym_payments']` was `[]`, so payments appeared empty even though they existed in Firestore
- Fix: init now only sets `adminAuthed = false` and hides the admin view. `lockAdmin()` (with data wipe) is still called from the logout flow and when `onAuthStateChanged` detects a non-admin user — but never during boot
- Combined with v0.30, payments now survive hard-refreshes and multi-device admin sessions

## 2026-08-10 — v0.30 (13:00) — Fix stale snapshot overwrite when dirty is clear (non-dirty branch)
- v0.29 fixed the dirty-client path where a stale STATE diffed against a newer mirror caused mass deletes. The remaining race was in the non-dirty branch: when dirty is clear and applied is true, any snapshot blindly replaced STATE with cloudArr (`STATE[cfg.state] = cloudArr`). A stale in-flight snapshot (common with two admin devices open) could delete records that existed locally and were just written to Firestore, reverting the database minutes later
- `applyCollectionSnapshotData()` now accepts previous mirror keys and, in the non-dirty branch, preserves locally-present records that were never seen in any prior mirror snapshot — they are recently created and the snapshot may not have caught up yet. If records are preserved, dirty is re-marked and a flush re-attempts
- `handleCollectionSnapshot()` now captures the mirror key set before updating it, passing it to `applyCollectionSnapshotData` for the stale-snapshot guard
- `flush()` is now async: `resolveFlush()` fires AFTER `diffAndWrite()` completes instead of synchronously before the async write finishes — the promise was resolving too early, which let `clearSensitiveData()` wipe STATE/localStorage before the Firestore commit landed on admin logout
- IMPORTANT: hard-refresh all devices (kiosk, admin, phones) and close old tabs — any device still running old JS can still trigger the race

## 2026-08-10 — v0.29 (12:05) — Fix database reverting to previous versions (sync engine)
- Root cause: while a client had pending local edits (dirty), a Firestore snapshot could not be applied to its in-memory STATE, but the diff baseline (mirror) was still refreshed to the newer cloud state. The next flush then diffed a STALE STATE against a NEWER mirror and treated cloud records the client simply hadn't loaded as "deleted locally" — a dirty admin client erased other devices' fresh check-ins/payments from Firestore, and a stale dirty client re-wrote old copies of docs back over the newer cloud versions. Net effect: a few minutes after any change, the database silently jumped back to a previous version
- `handleCollectionSnapshot()` now freezes the mirror (diff baseline) while a collection is dirty — it only advances once the pending edits flush and the collection turns clean again
- `applyCollectionSnapshotData()` now catch-up merges cloud records that lie outside the frozen baseline into a dirty STATE, so a client with pending local edits never goes blind to newer cloud docs and a flush can never delete docs it hasn't seen
- Also breaks a stall cascade: a permanently dirty client whose spurious deletes were denied by rules had every batch fail, freezing its STATE and pushing old data indefinitely; with a sound diff it now flushes cleanly and stays in sync
- IMPORTANT after deploy: hard-refresh every device (kiosk, admin, phones) and close all old tabs — any device still running the old JS can still delete data

## 2026-08-10 — v0.28 (11:30) — Persist settings to localStorage; batch notice save
- `memberStatsVisibility` and `showClassCheckins` now persisted to/loaded from localStorage (previously only in Firestore — offline page reloads silently reverted to defaults)
- `saveCheckinNotice()` now updates both notice text AND color in a single `saveToCloud()` call instead of two separate flushes
- Member directory column configuration (`columnsConfig`) now persisted to localStorage — column visibility and order survive page reloads

## 2026-08-10 — v0.27 (11:02) — Sync notifications reliably (same fix class as payments)
- Notifications is admin-read-only / kiosk-create: the diffAndWrite and markDirtyCollections `ready` gates could drop kiosk-created alerts (e.g. Frozen/Expired check-in attempts) when no notifications snapshot had been seen — notably after an admin logout reset ready and unsubscribed the listener — leaving the alert only in localStorage until the next wipe
- `diffAndWrite()` now never gates notifications writes on their first (admin-only) read snapshot; `markDirtyCollections()` now tracks local notifications as dirty before that snapshot too, so they flush to Firestore and are never replaced by a later cloud apply
- Admin re-login already force-resubscribes notifications (v0.25); with the above, kiosk-created alerts now also survive logouts and show up on every admin device

## 2026-08-10 — v0.26 (10:59) — Fix payments never syncing to Firestore (silently dropped saves)
- Root cause: `diffAndWrite()` skipped a collection until its first snapshot arrived (`ready` flag). Payments are admin-read-only, so on a fresh kiosk boot the anonymous listener errors and `ready['payments']` stays false — payment saves were silently dropped (localState/localStorage only) while the member update in the same batch synced fine, so the membership applied but the payment never reached Firestore and vanished after admin re-login
- `diffAndWrite()` now lets the admin client write admin-only collections (payments, plans, bins) even before their first snapshot: writes are merge-sets keyed by record id (safe against a not-yet-loaded cloud state), and the delete pass is still guarded by the `applied` flag so an empty local state can never wipe the cloud
- `lockAdmin()` now defers the `clearSensitiveData()` wipe until the pending Firestore flush promise resolves, so a payment saved right before logout is committed before the local copy is destroyed
- `clearSensitiveData()` now unsubscribes the still-live payments/notifications/bins listeners created under admin auth, so they can no longer re-populate wiped payment data into STATE/localStorage after logout on a shared device (next admin unlock re-subscribes them)

## 2026-08-10 — v0.25 (03:00) — Manual Firestore resync button in settings
- Added a "Resync Data" button in General Settings → Data Management that force-reloads all Firestore listeners — useful after hitting the read quota, after a permission-denied kills a listener, or when collections appear empty after a sync hiccup

- Export/Import backup now also stores and restores the check-in notice text, the "show recorded check-ins" setting, and the member statistics visibility toggles (previously only portalName/currency/colors were backed up)

- Fixed a data-loss bug where logging out and back in as admin deleted the entire payments/notifications/bins cloud data: `clearSensitiveData()` wiped the local arrays but left the sync engine's ready/applied/snapSeen/mirror state intact, so the next admin login's flush diffed an empty local list against the cloud mirror and issued delete ops for every document
- `clearSensitiveData()` now resets the sync metadata for the wiped collections so an empty local state can never be flushed as deletions, and admin unlock now force-resubscribes payments and the bins so the history reloads after every login

- The Statistics section in the member portal is now collapsible: clicking the Statistics header collapses/expands the stat cards (with a ▾/▸ arrow), and the collapsed state is remembered per device

- Member portal Leaderboard Rank moved out of the statistics grid into its own card, labeled "(last 90 days)" (the rank is computed over the trailing 3 months); it still respects the Member Settings visibility toggle
- The admin member modal's rank card now also shows the "(last 90 days)" suffix; Greek/English label added

- Total Hours Trained now displays as hours and minutes (e.g. "12h 30m") instead of a decimal number
- Added missing Greek translations so Total Trainings, Avg Trainings / Week, and Avg Trainings / Month no longer fall back to English
- Member portal header buttons reordered: language toggle now sits to the left of Logout

- "Avg Days / Month" is now an always-visible stat card (total training days ÷ months since first training) in both the admin member modal and the member portal, instead of only showing inside the Month toggle view
- Added a matching "Avg Days / Month" visibility toggle in Member Settings (visible by default)

- New "Avg Trainings / Day" stat card (total trainings ÷ distinct training days) in member statistics, shown in both the admin member modal and the member portal alongside the Week/Month averages
- Added a matching "Avg Trainings / Day" visibility toggle in Member Settings (visible by default) and Greek/English i18n labels

- Member portal now has a Week/Month switcher above the statistics that shows the averages per week (Avg Trainings/Week, Avg Days/Week) or per month (Avg Trainings/Month, Avg Days/Month); the choice persists per device and the admin member modal keeps showing the full set in both granularities
- New "Avg Days / Month" stat card and Greek/English labels for the switcher and section title

- New "Avg Days / Week" stat card in member statistics (admin member modal and member portal) counting distinct training days per week, so two trainings in the same day count as 1 day/week alongside Avg Trainings / Week
- Added a matching "Avg Days / Week" visibility toggle in Member Settings (visible by default) and Greek/English i18n labels

- Member Frequency Breakdown Avg / Week now divides by the member's active span rounded to the nearest whole week (min 1) instead of exact fractional weeks, so 3 trainings over ~7 days show as 3.0 rather than 2.9

- Fixed Firestore rules: AUTH-READ collections (settings, plans, schedules, closedDates, visits, classCheckins, members, meta) were gated on `isKiosk() || isAdmin()`, but `isKiosk()` excludes any token with an email claim — so Google-signed-in members were denied reading settings (including memberStatsVisibility), causing hidden Member Settings stats to reappear in fresh incognito member sessions. Reads now allow any authenticated token (`request.auth != null`); write rules unchanged

- New "Total Hours Trained" stat card in member statistics (admin member modal and member portal), summing each unique class session's duration with a 1-hour fallback and legacy visit entry→exit durations
- Added a matching "Total Hours Trained" visibility toggle in Member Settings (visible by default) and Greek/English i18n labels

- Fixed Revenue Per Member (and other retention KPIs) excluding today's payments when logged before noon: the preset analysis window now ends at end-of-day instead of the exact current instant, so payment dates (parsed at local noon) always fall inside the window
- KPI cards and the Member Frequency Breakdown now refresh immediately after saving a member or a payment while the Retention pane is open, instead of only on pane re-entry or period change

- The Member Frequency Breakdown table no longer shows the member ID badge under each name, leaving just the member's name

- Member directory: out-of-sessions members no longer get the red row/card background (that now applies only to expired members), and their status badge reads "Active (No Sessions)" instead of "No sessions"
- Check-in Log visit edit modal now has a Payment Status dropdown (Auto / Paid / Unpaid) letting admins force a visit paid or unpaid; the reconciliation engine respects the manual override and skips it when Auto is chosen

- Member Frequency Breakdown table now has clickable column headers (like Member Directory) that sort by Member, Belt, Classes, Avg / Week, or Segment, with asc/desc toggling and an arrow indicator
- Default sort stays "most at risk first" (Avg / Week ascending)
- Belt moved out of the belt-colored member-ID box under the name into its own Belt column as a textless belt-color box; the ID under the name is now a neutral gray badge

## 2026-08-10 — v0.8 (00:02) — Admin control over which member statistics members can view
- New "Member Settings" admin menu (separate sidebar entry under System) lets the admin toggle which personal statistics members see on their own dashboard: Total Trainings, Avg Trainings / Week, Avg Trainings / Month, Leaderboard Rank
- Settings sync to Firestore like other settings and default to all-visible; admins always see the full set in the member modal
- Member portal shows a muted "no statistics" message if every stat is hidden (en + el i18n)

## 2026-08-09 — v0.7 (23:52) — Keep KPI badges and titles inside their cards
- KPI card headers in Retention & Attendance now wrap instead of overflowing: the "Not tracked" / "Below target" / "On track" badge drops below the title on narrow cards and stays inside the box

## 2026-08-09 — v0.6 (22:40) — Unified checkbox/toggle aesthetic; scrollable tab bars
- All submenu tab bars (Member Directory, Membership Plans, Schedule, Notifications, Dashboard) are now horizontally scrollable at every screen size with tabs keeping full spacing (flex-shrink: 0) instead of squashing; added a thin scrollbar
- Removed the last raw native checkboxes from visible UI: plan "Allow raw HTML" now uses the switch toggle, settings "Show recorded check-ins" uses a pill — every visible checkbox across admin, kiosk, and member portals now uses one of the two canonical styles (switch for boolean, pill for multi-select)
- Day-picker pills now show a pointer cursor (drag cursor only on genuinely draggable pills)
- Added a "UI Aesthetics & Component Consistency" section to AGENTS.md documenting the two canonical checkbox styles, .tabs behavior, and shared .card rules so future UI stays consistent across all three portals

## 2026-08-09 — v0.5 (22:20) — Center check-in modals on phones instead of bottom sheets
- Check-in/public modals (Available Memberships, Available Classes, Class Details, Member Login, class selection, kiosk alert, staff check-in classes) now open centered on phones instead of pinned to the bottom of the screen
- Admin data-entry modals (member, payment, visit, export, custom color) keep the mobile bottom-sheet layout

## 2026-08-09 — v0.4 (22:05) — Show language name next to flag in kiosk/member menu
- The Language item in the kiosk and member-portal sliding menus (phone mode) now shows the flag plus the language name ("🇬🇧 English" / "🇬🇷 Ελληνικά") instead of the flag alone

## 2026-08-09 — v0.3 (21:50) — Hide dates in public class check-ins; admin toggle for check-in visibility
- Recorded check-ins in the public Class Details view no longer show the date (it's the clicked class date, so it's redundant)
- Added a "Class Details Visibility" setting in admin General Settings to choose whether recorded check-ins are shown publicly
- New setting is synced to Firestore like other settings and defaults to public

## 2026-08-09 — v0.2 (21:35) — Center table header labels across all lists
- Table header (`th`) text is now centered in every list/table in the app (Member Directory, Payments, Plans, Closed Dates, Schedule, Visit Log, Retention, member history, etc.)
- Row content (`td`) and section titles remain left-aligned

## 2026-08-09 — v0.1 (21:21) — Add unpaid check-ins counter to admin dashboard
- Dashboard stats now show an "Unpaid Check-ins" card with the count of outstanding unpaid visits (red when > 0, green when zero)

## 2026-08-09 — Flag-only language button in member portal and check-in
- Language toggle button in the kiosk/member drawers now shows only the flag emoji (UK flag for English, Greek flag for Greek), no text

## 2026-08-09 — Add manual "Cancelled" member status for admins
- Added "Cancelled" option to the Account Status dropdown in the member modal so admins can cancel members manually
- Directory badges, status filter tab, and exports recognize the stored Cancelled status (filter also still includes 90d+ no-training members)
- Cancelled members are blocked from kiosk/mobile self check-in and flagged as unpaid like Frozen/Inactive
- Added cancelled status messaging in staff check-in and member portal (en + el i18n)

## 2026-08-09 — Add CSV export to Retention & Attendance
- Added "Download CSV" button to the Member Frequency Breakdown card in the Retention & Attendance pane
- Export honors the current segment filter and includes member ID, name, belt, classes, avg/week, and segment

## 2026-08-09 — Wire class capacity into schedule editor; refresh KPIs on retention pane
- Class capacity field wired into the schedule editor UI
- Retention pane now refreshes KPIs after data changes

## 2026-08-08 — Force dd/mm/yyyy date display in admin and member portals
- Admin and member portals now force dd/mm/yyyy date format throughout

## 2026-08-07 — Custom date range view for retention statistics
- Added custom date range picker to the retention statistics view
- Allows admins to narrow retention analysis to arbitrary date windows

## 2026-08-06 — Trial plans, trial conversion KPI, and cancelled (90d) status
- Added trial membership plan support
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate KPI on the admin dashboard
- New "cancelled (past 90 days)" member status filter

- Fixed a sync merge-guard bug that could discard cloud data
- Fixed admin-lock flush that could leak sensitive data on logout

## 2026-08-02 — Update AGENTS.md with deployment instructions
- Added deployment instructions and push-reminder rule to AGENTS.md

## 2026-08-01 — Fix member private data and notification sync for fresh incognito admin login
